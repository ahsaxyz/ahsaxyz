# ahsa

Solana developer focused on building tools, systems, and experimental infrastructure.

Interests:
- Solana tools + onchain experiments  
- AI systems + autonomous agents  
- Trading and execution tooling  
- On-chain infrastructure  

Most of what I build sits at the intersection of Crypto, AI, and automation.  
Constantly experimenting, shipping, and refining ideas.
